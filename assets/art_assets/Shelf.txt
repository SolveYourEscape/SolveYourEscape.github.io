Here is the bookshelf I have modeled for the study room. While the bookshelf was the very first model I created, I went back to make some final tweaks, such as beveling the shelves to make the dropoff less sharp, as seen in the wireframe shot, and to add the necessary textures. The bookshelf model will eventually be incorporated by the tech team into one of the puzzles, most likely to put a book onto one of the shelves in the correct spot.
