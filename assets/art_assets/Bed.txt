Here is the progress on the canopy bed for the bedroom. The bedposts were made in 3DS Max using the lathe modifier, but since I am generally more comfortable doing hard surface modeling in Maya, I imported them into Maya to continue modeling the rest of the bed. I am also working on some draping curtains for the canopy part of the canopy bed using the cloth modifier in 3DS Max, but the curtains have not yet been added to the Maya file.
