Here are a couple views of what the bathroom looks like at the moment. The odd colors are the result of placeholder materials used to help the tech team in the implementation process when it comes to adding the textures. Objects in the same color share a material and will eventually also share a texture. The bright colors also help me distinguish what still needs to be textured.
