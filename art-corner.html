                        <p>The first order of business was deciding what sort of game to make. Keeping in mind the time limitations for this project, we realized we would need to limit the scope. We ended up settling on an escape the room type game since it lends itself particularly well to creating a "slice" of a larger game. Additionally, it also allows us to present players with a challenge rather than just a display of art assets. Below are some mockups of the game environment.</p>

The bedposts were made in 3DS Max using the lathe modifier, but since I am generally more comfortable doing hard surface modeling in Maya, I imported them into Maya to continue modeling the rest of the bed. I am also working on some draping curtains for the canopy part of the canopy bed using the cloth modifier in 3DS Max, but the curtains have not yet been added to the Maya file.</p>

                        <p>Here is the bookshelf I have modeled for the study room. While the bookshelf was the very first model I created, I went back to make some final tweaks, such as beveling the shelves to make the dropoff less sharp, as seen in the wireframe shot, and to add the necessary textures. The bookshelf model will eventually be incorporated by the tech team into one of the puzzles, most likely to put a book onto one of the shelves in the correct spot.</p>

The odd colors are the result of placeholder materials used to help the tech team in the implementation process when it comes to adding the textures. Objects in the same color share a material and will eventually also share a texture. The bright colors also help me distinguish what still needs to be textured.</p>

                        <p>The bed was probably the most time consuming model. The bed posts were made using a spline shape and a lathe modifier in 3DS Max, while the curtains were made using a Cloth Modifier. The biggest problem I ran into was trying to get the curtain to wrap around the bed post. I spent about four or five hours on getting it to wrap correctly before finally deciding that it was close enough and masking the imperfect parts with an additional polygon that ties the curtain to the post.</p>

                        <p>The entertainment center was one of the most difficult pieces to model due to its many facets and extrusions. The UV process was also challenging. Fortunately, the model is symmetrical, so I was able to get away with UV unwrapping only half of the model and mirroring it onto the other side.</p>
