The odd colors are the result of placeholder materials used to help the tech team in the implementation process when it comes to adding the textures. Objects in the same color share a material and will eventually also share a texture. The bright colors also help me distinguish what still needs to be textured.</div>

Keeping in mind the time limitations for this project, we realized we would need to limit the scope. We ended up settling on an escape the room type game since it lends itself particularly well to creating a "slice" of a larger game. Additionally, it also allows us to present players with a challenge rather than just a display of art assets. Below are some mockups of the game environment.</div>
