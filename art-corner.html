                        <h4>Intial Room Plan</h4>
                        <p>The first order of business was deciding what sort of game to make. Keeping in mind the time limitations for this project, we realized we would need to limit the scope. We ended up settling on an escape the room type game since it lends itself particularly well to creating a "slice" of a larger game. Additionally, it also allows us to present players with a challenge rather than just a display of art assets. Below are some mockups of the game environment.</p>

                        <p>Here is the progress on the canopy bed for the bedroom. The bedposts were made in 3DS Max using the lathe modifier, but since I am generally more comfortable doing hard surface modeling in Maya, I imported them into Maya to continue modeling the rest of the bed. I am also working on some draping curtains for the canopy part of the canopy bed using the cloth modifier in 3DS Max, but the curtains have not yet been added to the Maya file.</p>

                        <p>Here is the bookshelf I have modeled for the study room. While the bookshelf was the very first model I created, I went back to make some final tweaks, such as beveling the shelves to make the dropoff less sharp, as seen in the wireframe shot, and to add the necessary textures. The bookshelf model will eventually be incorporated by the tech team into one of the puzzles, most likely to put a book onto one of the shelves in the correct spot.</p>

                        <p>Here are a couple views of what the bathroom looks like at the moment. The odd colors are the result of placeholder materials used to help the tech team in the implementation process when it comes to adding the textures. Objects in the same color share a material and will eventually also share a texture. The bright colors also help me distinguish what still needs to be textured.</p>

While I generally prefer using Photoshop and the UV system in Maya for most models, since this was an organic model rather than a hard surface model, using the polypaint functionality in ZBrush was my best bet.</p>
